<div class="aboutme">
<p>My name is Alice, and I’m a massive fan of cinematography. My whole life, I have been obsessed with films and cartoons, and that’s why I spend most of my time watching and observing movies. </p>

<p>My favourite genre is Science-Fiction.  Films such as «Interstellar», «Arrival», or «Supremacy» fascinate and delight me to the core.  I love to watch how reality is intertwined with something fantastic but, at the same time, scientifically based.  Such masterpieces make me believe that in the future, we will reach heights in science and technology.  We will be able to explore the other galaxies, discover the entirety of space and meet alien races. These films often show what the truth of human nature is and encourage the audience to reflect on our inner belief in happiness, love and hope.  </p>

<p>That is how my favourite film, "Interstellar" does, it shows that Love is the one thing that transcends time and space, and we should trust that, even if we cannot understand it. Love and Hope are things that will remain unchanged for humans even in another part of the galaxy.</p>
